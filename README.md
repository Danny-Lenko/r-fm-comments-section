## Overview

### Functionality

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- Use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- Use timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

App's intended behaviour:

- First-level comments are ordered by their score, whereas nested replies are ordered by time added.
- Replying to a comment adds the new reply to the bottom of the nested replies within that comment.
- A confirmation modal pops up before a comment or reply is deleted.
- Adding a new comment or reply uses the `currentUser` object from within the `data.json` file.
- You can only edit or delete your own comments and replies.
